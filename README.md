## Questions that could occur

### What does <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0810-software/encryptcompressmydrive7/master/img/Logo4.png" alt="EncryptCompressmyDrive7" height="25" /> do?

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0810-software/encryptcompressmydrive7/master/img/Logo4.png" alt="EncryptCompressmyDrive7" height="20" /> basically does what it says it does:  Drive compression and encryption.

But in detail, the system creates a `.ecmd7`-file with a file name based on the username of the user. Because `.ecmd7`-files are basically 7-zip files with a special file name extension, they can not only compress the user files but also encode them, the data about the drive itself and other information needed is saved into `.ecd7db`-files which are just plaintext files with an alternate file name extension and with the purpose of databases.

### Is <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0810-software/encryptcompressmydrive7/master/img/Logo4.png" alt="EncryptCompressmyDrive7" height="25" /> save?

It is save, but probably not uncrackable. Of course nothing is 'fully' save, but I will warn you if there is anything wrong. The encryption in <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0810-software/encryptcompressmydrive7/master/img/Logo4.png" alt="EncryptCompressmyDrive7" height="20" /> is based on 7z encryption, which has shown great results for the past years. Of course you are advised to pick a strong password, this will make it lots harder to crack your data.
